# Project status and handoff

Last updated: 2026-09-24 (UTC). Read this after `AGENTS.md` when picking the project up. It records the current state, open decisions and known problems that are not obvious from the code. Update it when any of these change.

## Where things are

| Area | State | Docs |
|---|---|---|
| Science | One known-planet recovery test and one residual screen (WASP-12, TESS S20/S43): **bounded null, no candidate**. `tess-mono-01` is a **draft** (no targets, thresholds deliberately unset). No candidate dossiers exist. | `campaigns/`, `reports/`, their `sky_record.json` |
| Tier-1 baseline pack | 132 manifest rows from 8 archives, checksummed. Products live in private cloud storage (`cygnus:Cygnus/…`); the repo holds manifests only. Engineering baseline, not a scientific result. | `docs/tier1_pack/` |
| Public site (v1) | Static generator working: 26 pages, 39 public files, leak scan clean. Not deployed anywhere. | `docs/PUBLISHING.md` |
| Site redesign | User found v1 too plain. An interactive **sky explorer prototype** is built and the direction approved; **converting the real site is not yet approved.** | `design-system/mockups/README.md` |
| Sky records | Every analysis must leave `sky_record.json`; tests fail otherwise. | `docs/SKY_RECORDS.md` |
| Design system "Ad Astra" | Source in `design-system/project/`. A browsable copy exists as a private claude.ai artifact (only reachable from Claude). It still describes the **v1** look, not the explorer. | `design-system/project/README.md` |
| Repository | GitHub `mapsugui/ad_astra`, branch `main`. Licence Apache-2.0; third-party data keep their own terms (see README). | `README.md` |

## Open decisions (ask the user; do not assume)

1. **Convert the published site to the explorer design?** The plan: the explorer as the home page, one page per target and an observing log. After that, update `design-system/project/` to match.
2. **Publish the restricted source archive** in `publish/collections/cygnus-software-0-1-0.json`? It was withheld while no licence existed; the licence is now Apache-2.0, but nobody has decided to publish it.
3. **Deployment target** for `build/site/` (GitHub Pages or another static host). Nothing is deployed.
4. **Logo.** Direction chosen (2026-09-24): concept **D**, the Northern Cross badged with a transit chord at a seeded random angle (`design-system/brand/build_brand.py`, `transit_params`). Revised the same day to rigid four-point spike stars and a heavy transit bar that breaks through the rim, angle drawn from hard diagonals (25–65° or 115–155°). Still to pick: the seed (alternatives in `design-system/brand/index.html`). Then: final outlined SVGs, favicon set, explorer header, site and design system.
5. If the explorer's Gaia-derived files are published, Gaia's share-alike terms (CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO) apply to those files.

## Known problems (surface them; do not paper over)

- Ledger run #1 measurements cite product `tesscut-219.7570--80.5310-sec12`, but the ledger's product row is `…-sec12-cam3-ccd1`. The site shows it as unresolved.
- Several `cygnus.ingest.tier1` runs are `open` with no close recorded.
- The ledger (`state/ledger.sqlite`) is not in git and was being written by ingest jobs during the last session; ledger-derived pages are only as fresh as the last build on a machine that has it.
- `docs/TEST_ARCHITECTURE_PLAN_DRAFT.md` lists unaddressed safety gaps: MAST live-test scratch isolation, pack retirement verifying zero rows, ledger referential integrity.
- The residual screen's −5 robust-MAD threshold is uncalibrated; pixel-level, centroid, injection–recovery and literature checks were not tested.

## Environment notes

- Windows workstation originally; `.gitattributes` forces LF line endings.
- Private storage and scratch paths from `AGENTS.md` exist only on the original workstation. A cloud or other machine has no Drive access and no ledger; the test suite and both site builds still run (`python -m pytest -q`, `python -m cygnus.publish build`, `python design-system/mockups/build_explorer.py`).
- Never commit credentials, `rclone.conf`, FITS products, `state/` or `.env` (`.gitignore` covers them).
