## Bottom line

Positive control **not tested**: no retrieved light curve covers a catalogued transit epoch.
Outside the catalogued epoch the screen left **no** threshold entries: a bounded null within the completeness below.

This is a pipeline check on a known object, not a discovery claim. No period is implied by a single transit.

## Products

| Product | Kind | Sector | Covers catalogued epoch | SHA-256 (first 16) | Retrieved now |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Positive control (catalogued transit)

| Product | Epoch (BJD) | State | Usable in-transit cadences | Measured depth (ppm) | Catalogue depth (ppm) | Entry offset (h) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

Depth: median PDCSAP residual inside ±duration/2 about the catalogued epoch, against a 2-d running median; the error is statistical only. A depth unlike the catalogue's may reflect dilution, detrending or an epoch/duration error; it is reported, not used as a pass mark.

## Calibration and sensitivity

| Product | k* (sign-flip null) | At grid floor | 90 % completeness depth at k = 5, by duration | at k* |
|---|---|---|---|---|

The null result (if any) excludes only dips deeper than the 90 %-completeness depth for their duration.

## Screen events outside the catalogued epoch

None at the threshold used.
